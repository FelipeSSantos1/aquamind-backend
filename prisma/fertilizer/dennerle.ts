    name: "Dennerle Scaper's Green",
    description:
      "Scaper's Green stands out in particular due to its high nutrient concentrations and fast nutrient availability. The nutrient proportions have been chosen so that all micronutrients are taken up by the plants in roughly equal proportions. This means that even with long-term, regular application there is no harmful accumulation of individual nutrients. A deficiency of micronutrients can be avoided with appropriate dosage and application of Scaper's Green. Like all Dennerle liquid fertilisers, Scaper's Green is very stable, which means it has lasting, stable effects. In other fertilisers, the active substances break down after a short period of time, which can be recognised as a dark brown discolouration, and lose their effects",

    name: 'Dennerle Carbo Booster Max',
    description:
      'Carbon is the most important nutrient for aquarium plants. Around 40 % of a plant‘s dry mass is made up of it. It is usually lacking in aquaria. The consequence: poor plant growth. The Carbo products supply all aquarium plants with readily available carbon. All plants, from mosses, to Echinodorus and Cryptocorynes, to fast-growing stem plants, become fuller and stronger. The leaves become considerably larger and the colours more intense. The results are visible within a few weeks – noticeable on the shoot tips and young leaves. The lush, healthy growth increases the ability of the plants to compete with algae. Unwanted algae are therefore suppressed. The whole aquarium looks healthier and more beautiful',
