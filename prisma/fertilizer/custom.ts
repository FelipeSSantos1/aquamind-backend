      'Your plants need MACRO and MICRO elements as well as CO2 to thrive. If any of the components are running low missing from your water you will experience algae bloom. If you keep all fertilizers at proper levels and you change water regularly (once-a-week 50% is ideal) then fertilizer related algae issues will be virtually non-existent. Keep in mind, that most aquatic plants will also need proper CO2 injection to be healthy and you also need to have proper lighting and good filtration',
